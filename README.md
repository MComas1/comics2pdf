# comics2pdf
<h4>
A command-line tool to convert comic files (cbr, cbz) to pdf, in python3. Works in Windows. Linux not tested.
</h4>
# Install
<h4>
download the repo and run the command:
<br><code>python setup.py develop</code>
</h4>

# Usage
<h4>
go the directory of the file(s) and run the command:
<br><code>c2p</code>



It's a good idea to rename (before running the script) the .cbr/.cbz files that have
names like "01.cbz" to "Comic Name 01.cbz", as the output .pdf will get its name from
the input comic file.
